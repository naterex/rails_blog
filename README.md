# README

This is a project using Ruby on Rails to make a blog.

Users can create posts and add/delete comments for each one.

I made this project because I wanted to learn about:
  - How to setup models, views, & controllers without the use of scaffolds
  - creating nested routes
  - adding authentication using the gem Devis

## Stack
  - Ruby version: 2.2.1
  - Rails version: 4.2.4
  - Database: SQLite
  - Frontend: Custom CSS with "Raleway" font-family
